The geographic location of each image was mapped as a point and modeled flood depths were extracted from the underlying depth grids for each scenario represented in the Flood Level Rise application. To simulate what the relative flood levels would look like, a known reference measurement within the foreground and background of each image was used to calibrate potential water levels for each scenario. For example, a standard or regulated height of a road sign, bridge, or building.
